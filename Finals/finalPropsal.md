# Final Project Proposal
## Concept/Theme:
An interactive website that acts as a digital diary to keep track of my day to day life, using an animated calendar to keep track of my posts.

## Visual & UX Inspiration:
https://dayoneapp.com/ (but more personalized aesthetic)

https://daily-6210d.web.app/

## HTML/CSS/JS Skills I Plan To Use:
- CSS & JS Animations
- HTML Elements and NAV BAR for functionality
- HtmL buttons and text
- CSS hover and use of layout functions such as (align, flexbox, margin, padding, etc)
-Way to export writing each day if unable to use local storage and store all entries
