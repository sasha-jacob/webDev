# Rhizome's Net Art Anthology HW Response

For a project that resonated with me, I selected the 2003 made piece “DATA DIARIES”, by Cory Arcangel. Growing up as a kid, I always found reading and writing to be something that made me excited. I also used to love reading this series called, “Dork Diaries” by Nikki Maxwell, so when I saw this art project, I knew I had to click on it!
I was a bit confused reading this at first, but from my understanding, Arcangel used his leftover RAM from his computer to create very abstract, funky, or even “strange” online videos. He attempted this by opening his leftover RAM with QuickTime and then used a hack to turn them into “frenetic patterns of blocks and digital static.” I found this very cool because each piece is based on the user’s data each day, so no piece will look the same. I also thought his idea about these pieces speaking to those who grew up in a digital world as kids was very thoughtful. Some other artworks that also resonated with myself or that I found intriguing included the artwork of "Marisa’s American Idol Audition Training Blog" and "Refresh" by Kristin Sue Lucas.
